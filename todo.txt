we'll use node for the real-time part of delivering the page
everything else will be a regular site (including the php)
we'll run socket io and bind it to nginx so we have 2 parts

socket io delivers videos and timestamps, as well as potential eyeball information
client side is trivial -- make the connection once the player is ready
run play(vidId, timestamp) on the event 'vid'
on server side, we need some sort of producer. we can run a timer scheduler over a database
or we can do the redis publish subscribe model? can we bind node to a python process?

user: wonga
pass: rabbit

app name: astronaut

created redistogo account
redis://wonga:5a60ab6fed654ffd7da7bbf475e10538@cod.redistogo.com:9439/

try to use that with a local instance of astronaut

go to 
astronaut/web/site/cirrus/

>> node app.js
